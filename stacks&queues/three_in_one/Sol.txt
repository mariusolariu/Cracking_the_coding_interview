Create a class with an array attribute being. "Partition" it in three equal partition,
using 6  indices: first_top_index
first_upper_limit, middle_top_index, middle_upper_limit etc..
Adding a new element happens on the
top_*_index positions, as well as the
removing. When top_*_index reaches *_upper_l
element the respective stack is full.
Removing elements happens from the *_top_index position and a index having value
 -1 represents that the respective stack is empty.
